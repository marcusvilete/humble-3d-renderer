# humble-3d-renderer


This is a very, very humble 3D renderer i built while studying basic computer graphics.

While at it, i also wanted to learn / practice a bit of typescript.


I found the model that is being rendered on [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/), created by [alexdelker](https://sketchfab.com/alexdelker) under [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)

This is just an experiment,  not really "production ready", so be careful!

** Might take a while to load the model! **

** WASD to translate the camera **

** MOUSE to rotate the camera **
